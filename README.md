## Introduction
In one of the course assignments, we have experimented with RNN to generate and process text sequences. It was a very interesting experience and motivated us to study whether it is possible to train talkshow chatbots.  

In order to build chatbots capable of handling a wide range to topics, we trained our chatbots using the Chinese corpus from two of the PTT gossip forums: Gossiping and Women Talk. Both forums have their own styles of opinionated expressions. We aim to create chatbots to deliver quarrelsome or sarcastic responds to input queries.

## Directory instruction
* [`/1_ptt_crawler`](https://github.com/thisray/PTTChatBot_DL2017/tree/master/1_ptt_crawler): crawl Chinese articles from PTT.
* [`/2_make_QA`](https://github.com/thisray/PTTChatBot_DL2017/tree/master/2_make_QA): make data into Q&A corpus type.
* [`/3_chatbot_model`](https://github.com/thisray/PTTChatBot_DL2017/tree/master/3_chatbot_model): train & use chatbot. (We provide the dataset & model we have trained [here](https://github.com/thisray/PTTChatBot_DL2017/tree/master/3_chatbot_model#data--model-download).)
